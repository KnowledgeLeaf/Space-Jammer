~Environment
{
    !!Expansive universe(possibly procedural generating if desired)!!

~Module ideas
{
    "Lance"
    {
        Weapon & Shield module
        3 stage charge the places medium health shields around the player at various charge levels, if broken, charge ends
        If released without being broken, player dashes forward, and deals damage to anything the shields touch (Maybe invincible shields while dashing?)
    }
    "Flame Spitter"
    {
        Weapon module
        Close range high damage continuous stream, shields are down when used
    }
    "Launcher"
    {
        Weapon module
        Standard medium range projectile (Basically what's already in the game)
    }
    "Plasma Rail"
    {
        Weapon module
        Long range, High damage, Low fire rate (Maybe an electrical varient that does more damage to shields than to health)
    }
    "Robo Arm"
    {
        Pickup module
        Grabs one item at a time (but maybe really fast)
    }
    "Grav pull"
    {
        Pickup module
        Sucks in all items in a large radius, but slowly (basically what's already in the game)
    }
    "Hull Plating L/M/H"
    {
        Hull Plating that increases health and decreases speed based on being Light, Medium, or Heavy
    }
}
