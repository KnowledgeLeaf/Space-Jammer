{
	Inventory of (so far random) materials acquired from space junk
    {
        A scrolling inventory showing all types of materials you have in your inventory, with options to jettison each
    }

**~Environment**
{
    !!Expansive universe(possibly procedural generating if desired)!!
    {
        Have randomly spawning stations
        !!Probably start using pooling for various obstacles and stations to ensure performance!!
        {
            If lifestate goes to 0, or object gets too far away, instead of destroying, set active false, and send a call to the pooling manager to add it the list of objects inactive
            Inactive objects are allowed to be moved and set active again just outside the players visible range
        }
    }
	Station Rework
	{
        Setup stations to intialize with loot tables and mission tables + however many times the player has completed/acquired them overall
        Tell Spawner to send information about new spawned stations to PoolingManager

		Stations have multiple tabs for missions, exchanging materials, and exchanging ship parts
        {
            Missions
            {
                Collect certain materials
                Kill certain enemies
                Travel to certain areas (Probably a randomized distance away, or to other stations for now)
            }
            Exchange Materials
            {
                Shop shows how much the station and the player has
                Buy and sell minerals that have somewhat randomized per station prices, but prices change depending on how much the station has
                Materials get used up at random rates
                Sell All button w/confirmation
            }
            **Exchange Ship Parts**
            {
                Able to purchase parts from the station that get equipped immediately to your ship
                Randomized per station equipments
                Also a repair button
            }
        }

        Save station data for when stations have to despawn for performance

~Module ideas
{
    "Lance"
    {
        Weapon & Shield module
        3 stage charge the places medium health shields around the player at various charge levels, if broken, charge ends
        If released without being broken, player dashes forward, and deals damage to anything the shields touch (Maybe invincible shields while dashing?)
    }
    "Flame Spitter"
    {
        Weapon module
        Close range high damage continuous stream, shields are down when used
    }
    "Plasma Rail"
    {
        Weapon module
        Long range, High damage, Low fire rate (Maybe an electrical varient that does more damage to shields than to health)
    }
    "Robo Arm"
    {
        Pickup module
        Grabs one item at a time (but maybe really fast)
    }
    "Hull Plating M/H"
    {
        Hull Plating that increases health and decreases speed based on being Light, Medium, or Heavy
    }
    "Cutter Shield"
    {
        Shield that takes significantly less damage depending on how well aligned your edge is to the source of damage
    }
    **!!"Mobility Shield"!!**
    {
